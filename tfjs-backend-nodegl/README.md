# Headless WebGL backend for TensorFlow.js via Node.js

** This project is under heavy development **

This new backend will provide a light-weight headless WebGL runtime for TensorFlow.js running under Node.js. It aims to provide GL-based acceleration for IoT, desktop, and Node.js applications where large CUDA libraries are not a possibility.
